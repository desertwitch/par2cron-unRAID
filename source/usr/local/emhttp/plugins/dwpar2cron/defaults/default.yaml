# par2cron configuration file
# All options can also be set via CLI (CLI has precedence over configuration)

# ==============================================================================
# CREATE COMMAND SETTINGS
# ==============================================================================
create:
  # args: Set arguments passed directly to the par2 command
  # Changeable as needed for individual sets using the marker configuration
  #
  # Example: ["-r15", "-n1"] (15% redundancy, 1 recovery file)
  # Default: [] (empty)
  args: []

  # glob: File matching pattern for files to include in PAR2 sets
  # Changeable as needed for individual sets using the marker configuration
  #
  # Default: "*" (all files)
  glob: "*"

  # duration: Time budget per creation run (soft limit)
  # This is a best-effort limit; overshooting creations won't be interrupted
  #
  # Format: Go duration string (e.g., "1h", "30m", "2h30m")
  # Default: "" (no time limit)
  duration: ""

  # mode: PAR2 creation mode
  # Changeable as needed for individual sets using the marker configuration
  #
  # Options: "file" (one PAR2 set per file), "folder" (one PAR2 set per folder)
  # Default: "folder"
  mode: "folder"

  # verify: Whether to verify PAR2 files immediately after creation
  # Changeable as needed for individual sets using the marker configuration
  # Recommended to enable this always when using --duration in "verify" mode
  #
  # Default: false
  verify: false

  # log-level: Minimum severity level for log messages that are emitted
  #
  # Format: "debug", "info", "warn", "error"
  # Default: "info"
  log-level: "info"

# ==============================================================================
# VERIFY COMMAND SETTINGS
# ==============================================================================
verify:
  # args: Set arguments passed directly to the par2 command
  #
  # Example: ["-m500", "-q"] (memory ceiling 500MB, quiet mode)
  # Default: [] (empty)
  args: []

  # age: Minimum time between re-verifications of the same PAR2 set
  # Any PAR2 sets verified more recently than this will be skipped instead
  #
  # Format: Go duration string (e.g., "12h", "2d", "7d")
  # Default: "" (always verify every set)
  age: ""

  # duration: Time budget per verification run (soft limit)
  # This is a best-effort limit; overshooting verifications won't be interrupted
  #
  # Format: Go duration string (e.g., "1h", "30m", "2h30m")
  # Default: "" (no time limit)
  duration: ""

  # skip-no-manifest: Skip PAR2 files that don't have a par2cron manifest
  # Useful to only verify PAR2 sets that were actually created by par2cron
  # Alternatively use the par2cron-ignore files to exclude certain folders
  #
  # Default: false
  skip-no-manifest: false

  # skip-no-creation-manifest: Skip PAR2 files without a creation manifest
  # Useful to only verify PAR2 sets that were actually created by par2cron
  # This is the same as above but even more strict (usually not recommended)
  #
  # Default: false
  skip-no-creation-manifest: false

  # calc-run-interval: How often you run par2cron verification
  # Used to calculate and warn about verification backlog growing
  # Set this to the interval you run your cronjobs at (usually daily)
  #
  # Format: Go duration string (e.g., "12h", "2d", "7d")
  # Default: "24h"
  calc-run-interval: 24h

  # Default: "info"
